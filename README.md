This code is based on [https://github.com/cbfinn/gps](https://github.com/cbfinn/gps), and modified to be compatible with tensorflow 1.3.0 and MujocoPro131. Please follow [http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps/#installation](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps/#installation) to install necessary dependencies and compile protobuffer.

The MujocoPro131 has already been in src/3rdparty/mjpro. It requires a license, please obtain a key which should be named mjkey.txt and place the key into the mjpro directory.

GPS
======

This code is a reimplementation of the guided policy search algorithm and LQG-based trajectory optimization, meant to help others understand, reuse, and build upon existing work.

For full documentation, see [rll.berkeley.edu/gps](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps).

The code base is **a work in progress**. See the [FAQ](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps/faq.html) for information on planned future additions to the code.
